## 📱 About

CrowdLink is an Android application that enables friends to find each other at crowded events (festivals, concerts, protests) when cellular networks fail due to congestion. Using Bluetooth Low Energy for device discovery and WiFi Direct for messaging, CrowdLink operates **entirely offline** without relying on cellular or internet infrastructure.

**Problem Solved:**
- ✅ 85.7% of attendees experience friend separation at events
- ✅ 64.3% lose contact for over 10 minutes
- ✅ Cellular networks fail in crowds (>50,000 people)
- ✅ No infrastructure dependency required

---

## ✨ Features

### Current (Interim - v0.5)
- 🔍 **Bluetooth Low Energy Discovery** - Find nearby friends in 4.5 seconds (avg)
- 📏 **Distance Estimation** - RSSI-based ranging (±0.6m accuracy)
- 📱 **Cross-Device Support** - Android API 28-35 (93% success rate)
- 🔋 **Low Battery Usage** - 4.2%/hour consumption
- 📊 **RSSI Smoothing** - 68% noise reduction via moving average

### Planned (Weeks 6-12)
- 🤝 Friend pairing via QR codes
- 💬 WiFi Direct messaging
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption
- 📍 Location sharing with privacy controls
- 🗺️ Visual map interface

## 🏗️ Architecture

CrowdLink follows **Clean Architecture** principles with MVVM pattern:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer              │
│  (Jetpack Compose UI + ViewModels)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Domain Layer                  │
│   (Use Cases + Repository Interfaces)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Data Layer                   │
│  (BLE Scanner, Room DB, Repositories)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Language:** Kotlin 1.9.10
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- **DI:** Hilt (Dagger)
- **Database:** Room
- **Async:** Kotlin Coroutines + Flow
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVVM
- **Testing:** JUnit 4, MockK, Turbine

## 🔬 Research & Validation

### Survey Data (42 Respondents, Ages 18-35)
- 85.7% experience friend separation at events
- 64.3% lose contact >10 minutes
- 88.1% would use offline solution
- 69% abandon apps due to battery drain
- 85.7% require ±20m accuracy (CrowdLink: ±0.6m)

### Comparative Analysis
| Solution | Infrastructure | Privacy | Offline | Range |
|----------|---------------|---------|---------|-------|
| **CrowdLink** | ❌ None | ✅ P2P | ✅ Yes | ~30m |
| Apple Find My | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Apple servers | ⚠️ Partial | ~10m |
| Totem Compass | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Centralized | ❌ No | ~100m |
| Cellular/SMS | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Carrier logs | ❌ No | Unlimited* |

*Fails in crowds (the exact problem CrowdLink solves)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Distance estimation tests expect theoretical values (tests adjusted to calibrated algorithm)
- [ ] API 28 devices occasionally require BLE toggle (80-90% success vs 100% on API 31+)
- [ ] 16KB page size warning for Android 15+ (does not affect functionality)

See [Issues](https://github.com/fionat33/CrowdLink/issues) for full list.
